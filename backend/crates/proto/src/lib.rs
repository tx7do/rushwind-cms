//! The CMS API contract crate — everything generated from the synced
//! proto tree (`api/protos`, checksummed by `api/MANIFEST.sha256`):
//!
//! * [`proto`] — the types: prost structs + pbjson protojson serde.
//! * [`DESCRIPTOR_BYTES`] / [`pool`] — the annotated full compile closure:
//!   buf-produced (protox's serializer would drop the custom-option
//!   bytes — google.api.http / errors.code — which are the point), decoded
//!   once into the immutable process-global pool. The schema surface for
//!   protojson serialization and form binding.
//! * [`gen`] — the build-time-emitted surface (the framework's
//!   `rushwind-gen-http` over the annotated closure): route table with
//!   form-binding plans, reason → HTTP status error tables, one service
//!   trait per annotated BFF service (the admin and the app BFF both
//!   ride here), null placeholder impls, and the public/gated mount
//!   emitters split by [`AUTH_FREE`].
//! * [`tables`] — handwritten accessors over the generated error tables.
